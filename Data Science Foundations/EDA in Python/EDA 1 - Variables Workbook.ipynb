    "This is a clever technique for making comparisons. We are essentially decomposing a categorical variable into a new binary variable for each of the categories of the original variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you consider our ratings, we end up with\n",

    "G, NOT_G\n",
    "PG, NOT_PG\n",

    "We might not need NR anymore as it would represent a case where a movie is NOT_X for all 4 OHE variables. It ultimately depends on whether or not we want to provide a comparison for NR. (This provides context on *implicit* information vs. *explicit* information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A few important notes:**\n",
    "- There is no ordering, so consider this. OHE is more popular for nominal values, but it can still be used for ordinals, *especially when we don't want to assume there is equal spacing between the categories* (i.e. like a Likert scale)\n",
    "- we use a method called ```get_dummies()``` in pandas. (the dummy is the OHE variable). It is creating an entirely new dataframe w/ a different set of variables to the original dataframe.\n",
    "- OHE works best for categories w/ a small number of variables, especially for **ML Modeling**. Adding variables increases dimensionality of the dataframe, which creates problems w/ certain ML modeling techniques. (It can make it run slower, and add noise to the calculations)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it would make sense to use it on ```ratings```, where the distance between each rating is ambiguous. It wouldn't make sense to apply it to ```country```, because there are 200+ countries in the world (probably not as many making movies, but I digress). "
